		<h1>The industry, competition and market</h1>
		<p>
		<span style="font-size: 500%; line-height: 70%; font-family: algerian,courier; width: 0.5em; float: left;">I</span> consider my completion to be stiff because there are other companies that have the same thing but do not offer all the services at once, this companies have access to large market and capital to have their ideas running.
I will work hard to fix the problem within the agricultural sector that my success after fixing the problems will be the measure against the completion.
My local competitors are business people who are still buying products from the farmers, The Sacco’s who are offering loans to the farmers and large shops offering farming equipment’s to the farmers
Regional competitors are the manufacturing companies that process farm products to final products example milk processing facilities and flour milling companies
National competitors are among the government parastatals who run almost the entire process of farming. Examples are NCPD, KCC and KTDA who offer almost everything to the farmers
Trends I see in the industry is that most companies dealing with agricultural products are the most protectable because they get all their products locally are they are readily available.
My customer have the same characteristics where they need a largest market to sell their products. Most farmers need place to get financial help or assist. Financial institutions needs places to sell their services thus they will see the advantage of this service.

		<p>
		<span style="font-size: 500%; line-height: 70%; font-family: algerian,courier; width: 0.75em; float: left;">M</span>y service is offering market to farmers and their assists such as financial institutions and production companies.
The service will be paid as a percentage of the service sold. It will be determined by the state of the transaction on the commodity where the successful commodity or service will be paid for.
My service will be available to anyone who needs the access it at any means. And I will promote the product through advertisement and public awareness. Promotion will also involve customer awards through promotions.
My competitive advantage is that all the services to the farmer will be offered at the same place in the same platform where other companies do not offer them at the same place. Most companies dwell in one product or service but this will involve everything that have advantage to the farmer.
My product will be distributed though internet and mobile phone applications. My use of advertising will consist of online advertisement, bill boards and media houses.
I will get feedback from the customers by providing questioner after service has been offered to the same customer
